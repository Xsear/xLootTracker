v0.5e
    Private Release 6
    - Fixed an issue causing the addon user to automatically need roll everything (oops)
    - Fixed an issue where the function handling replacement in messages wasn't handling its parameters properly and sometimes halted execution due to errors.
    - Implemented %t, rollType replacement for roll declaration messages.
    - Waypoints now handle item names with ^Q in them more elegantly.
    - Waypoints now display item icon
    - Fixed an issue where if a roll was hardcancelled by clearing the list of identified items, the addon could get stuck in a state where it was unable to roll new items because the code to clean up after a roll had been cancelled halted with references to non existant items

v0.5d
    Private Release 5
    - Added option to disable version message
    - Changed roll timeout timers to run on the individual timers for loot
    - Added message replacement functionality to get rid of ugly ^Q. Usage of %i will always print item name, removing ^Q if encountered. Usage of %iq will print item name with quality if ^Q is encountered. This isn't optimal at all... will improve.
    - Fixed loot despawn alarm reset (aka despawn timers... again...)
    - Fixed an issue where the addon would send too long chat messages. The addon will now try to use linebreaks (\n) in order to split too long messages into multiple. 

v0.5c
    Private Release 4
    - Fixed a bug with fallback icons for panels, causing them to break when universal gear dropped
    - Improve waypoint removal behavior
    - Fixed despawn timers (again)

v0.5b
    Private Release 3
    - Fixed messages not working at all (oops)
    - Fixed tracker not clearing old list items before rewriting them, causing illegible text
    - Fixed tracker not calculating positions for list items properly
    - Fixed despawn timers breaking if waypoints were turned off (lol)
    - Improved the panels massively
        - No longer uses Airii mesh
        - Displays more data... frankly, displays data
        - Options that allow controlling some of the colors

v0.5a
    Private Release 2
