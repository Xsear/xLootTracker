    Improvements

        HUDTracker

            Add options to make hudtracker similar to that guy who requested stuffz in the thread, it will be nice

        Messages

            Move "Send on Squad/Platoon only" options to underneath the masterswitches, and disable them if master is not checked

            Add option to toggle the prefix of system messages - use long prefix xLootTracker by default?

            Add option to strip army tags from player names

    Reworks

        Filtering2

        Panels still don't display anything interesting


    New Features

        Keybinds

            Clear / Toggle Waypoints

                Update: Added this in Keybinds branch, but need better handling for options for it keycatcher widget or something


        Waypoint Smart Visibility Hotkey (probably not)

            The problem: When lots of loot is on the ground, even though I know there is an epic thanks to the HUDTracker, I can't find it easily in the forest of Waypoints.
            The solution I have in mind: Add a hotkey that when pressed toggles between different visibility modes for the Waypoints.
            It would just be a simple show/hide call on existing waypoints (needs to handle the addition of new waypoints whilst filtered too of course)
            Ideally it should only be a few modes, perhaps even just toggle between non-filtered and \"the most rare of the current item/s only\"

            Note: wip exists in oldwaypointvisibility branch

        Item Rolls Support (maybe)

            Add new state/s \"Rolling\" / \"Rolled\"
            Detect when looted item is rolled for and update state (or directly determin that it is in roll)
            New message event - is being rolled
