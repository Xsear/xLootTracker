    Look intos

        Biomass Sampels - Does it not color waypoint glow properly?

        Test that version message disabling works

    Improvements

        Add option to strip army tags from player names


        HUDTracker - Icon Mode - None looks bad

        Panels still don't display anything interesting


        Add option to toggle the prefix of system messages - use long prefix xLootTracker by default?

    New Features

            Clear / Toggle Waypoints


        Waypoint Smart Visibility Hotkey

            The problem: When lots of loot is on the ground, even though I know there is an epic thanks to the HUDTracker, I can't find it easily in the forest of Waypoints.
            The solution I have in mind: Add a hotkey that when pressed toggles between different visibility modes for the Waypoints.
            It would just be a simple show/hide call on existing waypoints (needs to handle the addition of new waypoints whilst filtered too of course)
            Ideally it should only be a few modes, perhaps even just toggle between non-filtered and \"the most rare of the current item/s only\"



        Item Rolls Support

            Add new state/s \"Rolling\" / \"Rolled\"
            Detect when looted item is rolled for and update state (or directly determin that it is in roll)
