[COLOR=#00ccff][SIZE=6][FONT=arial]History[/FONT][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[INDENT=1]Loot Tracker succeeds Xsear's Squad Loot Manager. Originally, the addon was written to give organised groups a system to distribute loot with. It was built in anticipation for a different kind of endgame than what Firefall eventually developed into. Additionally, an official need/greed system was implemented, eliminating the need for the systems that the addon was providing. Therefore, those systems were scrapped and the focus shifted towards improving the tracking system and providing more convenience features than before. The change of direction and feature set warranted a change of addon name, and thus, Loot Tracker was born.[/INDENT]

[COLOR=#00ccff][SIZE=6][FONT=arial]Issues[/FONT][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*]If you enter a tornado with Components tracking on, you're gonna have a bad time.
[*]Loot Panels do not currently provide any interesting information. They have not been updated for patch 1.0 yet.
[*]Whilst the filtering system provides a decent number of options, it hardly does so elegantly. I have ideas for a better system, but it is not yet on the horizon.
[*]The game sometimes changes its mind about loot drops. In order to not be fooled, the addon must delay certain actions.
