[COLOR=#00ccff][SIZE=6][FONT=arial]History[/FONT][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[INDENT=1]Loot Tracker succeeds Xsear's Squad Loot Manager. Originally, the addon was written to give organised groups a system to distribute loot with. It was built in anticipation for a different kind of endgame than what Firefall eventually developed into. Additionally, an official need/greed system was implemented, eliminating the need for the systems that the addon was providing. Therefore, those systems were scrapped and the focus shifted towards improving the tracking system and providing more convenience features than before. The change of direction and feature set warranted a change of addon name, and thus, Loot Tracker was born.[/INDENT]

[COLOR=#00ccff][SIZE=6][FONT=arial]Issues[/FONT][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*]If you enter a tornado with Components tracking on, you're gonna have a bad time.
[*]Loot Panels do not currently provide any interesting information. They have not been updated for patch 1.0 yet.
[*]Whilst the filtering system provides a decent number of options, it hardly does so elegantly. I have ideas for a better system, but it is not yet on the horizon.
[*]The game sometimes changes its mind about loot drops. In order to not be fooled, the addon must delay certain actions.

[COLOR=#00ccff][SIZE=6][FONT=arial]Changes[/FONT][/SIZE][/COLOR]
[CODE]
v1.12
    Public Release 12
    2014-08-14
    This is the first release of xLootTracker, forked from the original xSquadLootManager project. This changelog covers what's changed from the persepctive of someone who used the latest version of the previous project.
    - Distribution functionality has been dropped.
    - The Detection system (now refered to as the Tracker) has been revamped to work without quality. It should also be more reliable than it was before.
    - Alongside the new weapon and ability Modules, the addon now tracks loot that doesn't have to be interacted with to be picked up, including Components (any kind of crafting material) and Consumables (calldown items).
    - Filtering options have been updated to work with Rarity instead of Stage, and Item/Required levels instead of Quality. Additionally, the format of the titles of Waypoints and entries in the HUDTracker can now be customized. These options are placed within the Filtering options to allow different formats based on rarity.
    - Multiple entires of the same kind of item "stack" in the HUDTracker.
    - Waypoint and HUDTracker title formats can now be customized.
    - Switched to a more vocal formatting system (%i > {itemName}).
    - Tooltips from item links and the hudtracker compare themselves to what you have equipped.
    - The slash handles used by the addon can now be set from the setting (I have yet to lock down the slash commands though).
    - Removed some broken sound options.
    - Various code improvements and enworsements.
