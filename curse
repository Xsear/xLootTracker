== Xsear's Loot Tracker
//LOOT TRACKER 2: The Lootiest!//

=== Abstract
Loot Tracker was developed with one goal in mind: To assist the user in keeping an eye on all the loot that drops, and where it goes.

=== Features

==== Core
     *Tracks Equipment, Modules, Components, Salvage and Consumable item drops.
     *All features beyond tracking are considered additional and can be enabled or disabled seperately.
     *Everything is customizable in some way, in an attempt to cater to as many users as possible.
     *Most of the features can have different kinds of behavior depending on what kind of loot it is acting on (Filtering).

==== Waypoints
    *The addon can attach Waypoints to tracked items, helping you quickly locate drops over larger distances.
==== HUDTracker
    *The addon can display information about currently tracked item drops on your HUD, allowing you to keep track of things at a glance.
==== Sounds
    *The addon can play sounds in order to notify you when certain events occur.
==== Panels
    *The addon can attach Panels onto item drops, allowing you to inspect the item in detail when up close.
==== Messages
    *The addon can send customizable Messages to the Chat as certain events occur, keeping you and your Squad members in the loop of what is going on with the item drops.
